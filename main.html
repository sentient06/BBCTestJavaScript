        <h3>About this page</h3>
        <p>
            This is a small code focused in the PHPUnit testing code and the PHP project itself. This project is not "RESTful" because it was not the aim of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is only one controller in this project and there are no models because there is no intention of persisting data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JavaScript exists merely to reload the page with updated query strings and there is no sophisticated method of updating the data.
