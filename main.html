        <p>
            This is a small code focused in the Jasmine testing code and the JS code.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no intention of persisting data, so there are no models.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JavaScript code was designed in a way it follows an MVC architectural pattern by using subscriptions. Whenever the "do it!" button is clicked, the view object publishes a message intercepted by the controller, which generates the roman numeral and publishes another message received by the view. The interface is then updated with the new data.
        </p>
        <p>
            I left the logs of the MVC objects intact.
        </p>
